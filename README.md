# Byte-vault
A stand alone clean password generator and manager written completely from shell.

a single shell script capable of making passwords and securly storing them with encryption.

currently, the password manager is not implimented yet but is in progress
If you want to prevent tampering you may use [Bashfuscator](https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator) to ensure the script can not be messed with.

im open to feedback and things i can improve as a small developer, feel free to open a issue
